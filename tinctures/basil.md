### Attempts

##### 2020-01-09 (BAS001)
* 0.95 oz (weight) basil
* 3.5 oz (vol) New Amsterdam vodka

Minced basil into small strips. 0.95 oz is the entirety of 2 packages from Walmart. Sous vide at
130 degrees for 75 minutes

*Results*
Similar to HORE001, probably due to heat from sous vide. Definitely strongly smells/tastes of basil
