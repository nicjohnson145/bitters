# Strawberry

### Attempts

##### 2020-01-12 (STB001)

* 3.75 oz (lb) diced strawberries
* 4 oz (vol) New Amsterdamn Vodka

130 degrees for 80 min.

Not a very strong flavor, good smell though

##### 2020-01-13 (STB002)

* 8.29 oz (lb) diced strawberries
* 5 oz (vol) New Amsterdamn Vodka

130 degree for 80 min. 

Much better flavor, much stronger. Could probably still be improved when strawberries are in season
